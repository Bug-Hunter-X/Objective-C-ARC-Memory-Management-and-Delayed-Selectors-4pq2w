The solution addresses the issues in `bug.m`:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = nil; // Release previous string
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some other code ...
}
@end

//For delayed selectors, ensure the object's lifetime:

- (void)someMethodWithDelay {
    if (self) { // Check if self is still valid 
        [self performSelector:@selector(delayedMethod) withObject:nil afterDelay:2.0];
    }   
}
- (void)delayedMethod {
    //code to be executed after delay
}
```

For memory management, explicitly setting `myString` to `nil` before allocating a new string ensures that the old string is released, preventing leaks. For delayed selectors, always verify that the calling object is still valid before executing the delayed method, which is done with the `self` check.
